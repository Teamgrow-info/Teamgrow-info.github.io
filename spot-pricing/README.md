# GCP Pricing History Viewer

This tool displays historical GCP pricing data generated monthly.

## Local Development

To run the application locally:

1. Start the local HTTP server:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Main application page
- `styles.css` - Application styles
- `gcp_pricing_MM_YYYY.json` - Monthly pricing data files (generated by generate.py)
- `generate.py` - Script to generate monthly pricing data

## Notes

- The application automatically detects available pricing data files
- Starts from the current month and looks backwards until no file is found
- Files should follow the naming pattern: `gcp_pricing_MM_YYYY.json`
  (e.g., `gcp_pricing_11_2023.json` for November 2023)
